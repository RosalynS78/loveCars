diff. between react and bootstrap
-bootstrap - template-based front-end framework that provides ready-made templates for building applications.(css library)
-react - component-based framework(for more complex, interactive app. with dynamic gui)

Bootstrap framework is an excellent choice for building responsive websites quickly, while Tailwind provides complete design
flexibility and a unique approach to web design. MUI is perfect for React applications and provides a clean, modern design 
consistent with Google's material design guidelines
